i. Executive Summary
Through this assignment, I covered the basics of downloading and using mysql, sql table structures, and accessing data through simple queries. I loaded values from the customers and items tables with varying restrictions on which to load.

ii. MySQL Workbench
I downloaded it from online and did not use a vm. It was not too difficult but the setup process had a lot of wierd settings that I did not completly understand.

iii. Queries
They were fairly simple and by using what I had learned in the textbook i completed the assignment by writing out the select statement and then applying the restrictions. All of this while using proper indentation etiquette.

iv. Conclusion
This was the first time I had been able to control any database myself and it makes me curious as to what I can do in the future. It had always been a black box for me when it came to accounts and information on servers and wesites. But now I am excited to learn about it and then see what I can make with the new skills I learn.
